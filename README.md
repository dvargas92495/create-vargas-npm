# REPOSITORY IS DEPRECATED

Still need a replacement for generating generic `npm` packages. But generating full web apps have been moved to [fuegojs](https://github.com/dvargas92495/fuegojs).

# Create Vargas NPM

Opinionated way to generate new npm packages with latest technologies.

```bash
npm install -g create-vargas-npm
create-vargas-app [name]
```
